##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: November 14, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Learned about hash maps and it's implementation in python.

**Thoughts**: This is the second time I'm learning hash maps and this time it was with the intention to write a blog on it.Learning something with the intention to later teach/blog about it challenges your understanding.I went much deeper into the concept of collision resolution this time around and looked into methods like linear probing, quadratic probing, and chaining.

### Day 2: November 15, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Revised Ruby oops and mixins, learned file I/O, learned about serialization in ruby, also did the banking with ruby project on codeacademy. 

**Thoughts**: It's been a while since I last learned ruby, so i decided to start by first revising my oops concepts. Then I finished the banking with ruby project on codeacademy which really brought the concepts back into memory. Then I learned about file io in ruby using the IO class and not the built in file handling class. This helped me understand what's going on behind the scenes in the file class. Then I learned about the concept of serialization and how it is implemented in ruby. I also learned about different serialization formats like YAML and JSON.
