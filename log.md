##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: November 14, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Learned about hash maps and it's implementation in python.

**Thoughts**: This is the second time I'm learning hash maps and this time it was with the intention to write a blog on it.Learning something with the intention to later teach/blog about challenges your understanding.I went much deeper into the concept of collision resolution this time around and looked into methods like linear probing, quadratic probing, and chaining.
